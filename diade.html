<h2>About Dia de los Muertos:</h2>

<p>"The holiday is celebrated in the United States from October 31 to November 2. Its tradition calls for the creation of altars to deceased loved ones, decorated with photos, meaningful objects and their favorite foods said to attract their souls. Tradition also calls for petals of bright yellow-orange marigold flowers to guide them from the cemetery."</p>

"Observance of the holiday has gone from regional recognition into the mainstream, extending beyond Hispanic communities. In response, now even the chain pharmacy Walgreens is selling new Day of the Dead items in most of its stores."
